# Overview
For work, I do the A Cloud Guru course on Confluent Certified Developer for Apache Kafka (CCDAK). The scripts in this repository help me execute commands on the AWS sandbox.

## Structure

- acg_aws.pem : SSH Key for all servers *(not included in the repo)*
- aws_servers.txt : list with AWS server ip addresses
